1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:00,933
 In  India,  in

2
0:00:00,933 --> 0:00:01,966
 every  1 .89

3
0:00:01,966 --> 0:00:03,366
 seconds,  somebody  breaks

4
0:00:03,366 --> 0:00:04,033
 a  traffic  rule

5
0:00:04,033 --> 0:00:04,733
 and  this  is

6
0:00:04,733 --> 0:00:05,166
 due  to  a

7
0:00:05,166 --> 0:00:05,933
 silly  FA  called

8
0:00:05,933 --> 0:00:06,700
 Pissed  Under  effect.

9
0:00:06,900 --> 0:00:07,233
 You  know  it

10
0:00:07,233 --> 0:00:07,933
 very  well.  If

11
0:00:07,933 --> 0:00:08,566
 Ramu  is  not

12
0:00:08,566 --> 0:00:09,866
 stopping,  Raju  is

13
0:00:09,866 --> 0:00:10,699
 not  stopping  either.

14
0:00:10,966 --> 0:00:11,366
 Why  the  hell

15
0:00:11,366 --> 0:00:11,900
 should  I  stop?

16
0:00:12,066 --> 0:00:12,666
 A  red  signal,

17
0:00:12,866 --> 0:00:13,366
 who  are  80

18
0:00:13,366 --> 0:00:14,333
%  of  accidents

19
0:00:14,333 --> 0:00:15,033
 are  caused  by

20
0:00:15,033 --> 0:00:16,000
 breaking  simple  traffic

21
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:16,933
 rules,  like  not

22
0:00:16,933 --> 0:00:17,899
 wearing  helmets,  not

23
0:00:17,899 --> 0:00:18,566
 wearing  seat  belts,

24
0:00:19,133 --> 0:00:19,466
 driving  on  the

25
0:00:19,466 --> 0:00:19,966
 wrong  side  of

26
0:00:19,966 --> 0:00:20,533
 the  roads  or

27
0:00:20,533 --> 0:00:21,233
 jogging  on  folds.

28
0:00:21,633 --> 0:00:22,466
 This  causes  loss

29
0:00:22,466 --> 0:00:23,566
 of  1 .5

30
0:00:23,566 --> 0:00:24,633
 lakh  lives  every

31
0:00:24,633 --> 0:00:25,199
 year  that  could

32
0:00:25,199 --> 0:00:26,066
 be  saved  just

33
0:00:26,066 --> 0:00:27,066
 by  following  simple

34
0:00:27,066 --> 0:00:28,033
 traffic  rules.  Will

35
0:00:28,033 --> 0:00:28,800
 you  become  a

36
0:00:28,800 --> 0:00:29,566
 change  that  will

37
0:00:29,566 --> 0:00:30,600
 inspire  others  or

38
0:00:30,600 --> 0:00:31,066
 just  be  a

39
0:00:31,066 --> 0:00:31,966
 bystander  guy,  follow

40
0:00:31,966 --> 0:00:32,766
 traffic  rules  for

41
0:00:32,766 --> 0:00:33,533
 you,  your  loved

42
0:00:33,533 --> 0:00:34,166
 ones  and  your

43
0:00:34,166 --> 0:00:35,399
 countrymen?  Remember  the

44
